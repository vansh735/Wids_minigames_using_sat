Objectives covered as of now:

Reading up on propositional logic

1. Basic syntax and semantics
2. Satisfiability and Validity of Formulas
3. Normal Forms - CNF and DNF forms of formulas and complexity of checking satisfiability.
4. Encoding simple constraints as clauses
5. Understanding DPLL algorithm 
6. Implementing a very basic DPLL based solver in python
7. Encoding sudoku into constraints and solving it using the SAT solver.


The major exercise for the 2 weeks has been learning basics of python and going through the lecture slides of CS228.

This repo contains 2 major edits:
1. The Question 1 in Assignment 1 has been solved with proper code
2. A brief summary report of learnings from CS228 lecture slides
